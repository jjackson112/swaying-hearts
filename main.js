// theta is for the swaying, floating effect
// heart object has an "x" and a "y", heart class
// to make the heart you need 3 divs, a rectangle rotated at 45 degrees with 2 circles on top, appending them to the page
// setTimeout deletes them after 10 sec so the browser doesn't freeze
// setInterval creates new hearts and updates the function, making them sway again
